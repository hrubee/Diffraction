# `diffraction tui`

Open the terminal UI connected to the Gateway.

Related:

- TUI guide: [TUI](/web/tui)

Notes:

- `tui` resolves configured gateway auth SecretRefs for token/password auth when possible (`env`/`file`/`exec` providers).
- When launched from inside a configured agent workspace directory, TUI auto-selects that agent for the session key default (unless `--session` is explicitly `agent:<id>:...`).

## Examples

```bash
diffraction tui
diffraction tui --url ws://127.0.0.1:18789 --token <token>
diffraction tui --session main --deliver
# when run inside an agent workspace, infers that agent automatically
diffraction tui --session bugfix
```
